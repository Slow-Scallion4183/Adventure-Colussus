# Adventure-Colussus
A text-based adventure/rpg game


This is my first larger project using python. It is to create a text-based adventure/rpg game called 'Adventure Colussus' i have already layed some of the foundations for the game
but there is still much to do. I am looking forward to adding classes for both the enemies and the character you play as including saving your character using JSON. I would also like to do is to try not to hardcode my adventure. I want to make something where you pass a file that stores information about your adventure and automatically takes the user through it. A fellow redditor said YAML or JSON would be good for this, therefore i would like to give it a shot. So if anyone want to make any contributions, feel free. But other then that, happy coding! :D

Edit: We now have 4 people working on the project (which for me is really cool) so yeah, shoutout to them: robotlightsyou, wireboy5, ssguitarist and skepticalpotato2k (including me = 5)
