# Adventure-Colussus
A text-based adventure/rpg game


This is my first larger project using python. It is to create a text-based adventure/rpg game called 'Adventure Colussus' i have already layed some of the foundations for the game
but there is still much to do. I am looking forward to adding classes for both the enemies and the character you play as including saving your character using JSON. I would also like to do is to try not to hardcode my adventure. I want to make something where you pass a file that stores information about your adventure and automatically takes the user through it. A fellow redditor said YAML or JSON would be good for this, therefore i would like to give it a shot. So if anyone want to make any contributions, feel free. But other then that, happy coding! :D

Edit: We now have 5 people working on the project (which for me is really cool) so yeah, shoutout to them: robotlightsyou, wireboy5, ssguitarist, skepticalpotato2k and ChocolateTaco (including me = 6)

IMPORTANT INFO:

The development branch is where the most changes to the game will happen. Once we have reached an important milestones it will be compared and then merged with the master branch.
